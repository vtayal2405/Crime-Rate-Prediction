# Crime Rate Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting crime rates using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of crime records from various locations. It includes features such as crime type, location, time, and socio-economic factors. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation

## Machine Learning Techniques
This project employs several machine learning techniques to predict crime rates:
- **Linear Regression**: Used for basic trend analysis.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for better accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Used for classification-based crime predictions.
- **Neural Networks**: For deep learning-based predictions in complex datasets.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Crime_Rate_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step by step to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results
- Performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Visualizations of crime rate trends and predictions
